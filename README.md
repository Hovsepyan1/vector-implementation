# Vector Implementation in Python

This project contains a Python implementation of a **vector** data structure, providing essential operations for vector manipulation and arithmetic.

## Features

- **Vector Creation**: Supports the initialization of vectors with arbitrary dimensions.
- **Vector Addition**: Ability to add two vectors of the same dimension.
- **Vector Subtraction**: Ability to subtract one vector from another.
- **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiply a vector by a scalar.
- **Dot Product**: Compute the dot product of two vectors.
- **Magnitude Calculation**: Calculate the magnitude (length) of the vector.
- **Normalization**: Normalize the vector to have a magnitude of 1.
- **Cross Product (if applicable)**: Compute the cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hovsepyan1/vector-implementation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd vector-implementation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.

Usage
Here's an example of how to use the vector class:

python
Copy code
from vector import Vector

# Create two vectors
v1 = Vector([1, 2, 3])
v2 = Vector([4, 5, 6])

# Add vectors
v3 = v1 + v2

# Print result
print("Resultant Vector:", v3)

# Calculate the dot product
dot_product = v1.dot(v2)
print("Dot Product:", dot_product)

# Normalize vector
v1_normalized = v1.normalize()
print("Normalized Vector:", v1_normalized)
Available Methods
__add__(self, other): Add two vectors.
__sub__(self, other): Subtract one vector from another.
__mul__(self, scalar): Multiply a vector by a scalar.
dot(self, other): Calculate the dot product of two vectors.
magnitude(self): Return the magnitude (length) of the vector.
normalize(self): Return the normalized (unit) vector.
(Include other methods your class supports.)
